# Mastermind

A Java console application that is a simple version of the game Mastermind. 
The computer will generate a random four digit number, with each digit being between 1 and 6. 

After the player enters a four digit number as a guess, they'll receive feedback in the form of + and -.

A (+) plus sign will be printed for every digit in the guess that is both correct and 
in the correct position in their four digit number. 

A (-) minus sign will be printed for every digit in the guess that is correct but in the wrong position
in their four digit number. 

Nothing will be printed for incorrect digits in the guess. 

If the user can guess the randomly generated number within 10 turns, they win!
